# svg2images

Convert your SVG animation to image sequences :D
This software is based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoT0BlR-kTo), I'm just customizing it.

## Customizations:

- [ ] CLI arguments for SVG document (width, height, animation duration, and frame rate)
- [ ] CLI arguments for exporting the file
- [ ] CLI argument for input file for html
- [ ] CLI argument for input file for svg
